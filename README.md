# Atlantic Hurricane Tracker
Author: William Guo

This is a python script done to track hurricane coverage in the Atlantic Ocean between 2008 to 2018. 

- It tracks US Counties that were hit in that 10 year period
- It also tracks US Primary Roads which inlcudes interstates and state highways
- Also this is relegated to only within the Continental US and only Hurricanes that actually hit the USA
- It also includes a choropleth map of both counties and roads that were hit with categorization marked as the frequency of hurricane impacts between 2008 - 2018.
- Lastly a small report reporting the timeline of counties that were hit in a 10 year period as well as the frequency of each county being hit by a hurricane

Data was taken from the US Census for Counties, Roads and States for 2018 while hurricane data was taken from NOAA.
